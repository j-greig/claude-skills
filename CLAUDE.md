Custom Claude Code skills:
- context-setter: transforms vague requests into structured context documents with constraints, file order, and tasks
- web-browser: CDP tools for Chrome automation

Never use emoji in commit messages, or elsewhere.
Do not use the word 'just'.
Avoid hyphens and em-dashes as sentence breaks. Use proper sentences or parentheses instead.
