You are developing Claude Code skills that demonstrate effective prompt engineering.

## Skills in this repo:

- **context-setter:** transforms vague requests into structured context documents with constraints, file order, and tasks
- **web-browser:** CDP tools for Chrome automation

## Documentation

Use natural, human language with a tl;dr non-technical sketch to introduce complex concepts, and markdown formatting that aids skim-reading.

## Changelog

Update `CHANGELOG.md` when making meaningful changes to skills. Format: one date heading per day, a few terse sentences capturing primary change plus supporting improvements. First sentence describes the main feature/fix with specific detail. Later sentences list related formatting, documentation, or minor improvements.

## Style Rules
- British English throughout
- Never use emoji in commit messages, or elsewhere
- Do not use the word 'just'
- Never use contrastive redefinition: "it's not just X, it's Y" (e.g., "It's not just a tool, it's a framework")
- Avoid hyphens and em-dashes as sentence breaks. Use proper sentences or parentheses instead
